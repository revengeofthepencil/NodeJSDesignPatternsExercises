/*
7.3 A tamper-free queue: Create a Queue class that has only one publicly accessible method called
dequeue(). Such a method returns a Promise that resolves with a new element extracted from an
internal queue data structure. If the queue is empty, then the Promise will resolve when a new item
is added. The Queue class must also have a revealing constructor that provides a function called
enqueue() to the executor that pushes a new element to the end of the internal queue. The enqueue()
function can be invoked asynchronously and it must also take care of "unblocking" any eventual
Promise returned by the dequeue() method. To try out the Queue class, you could build a small HTTP
server into the executor function. Such a server would receive messages or tasks from a client and
would push them into the queue. A loop would then consume all those messages using the dequeue()
method.
